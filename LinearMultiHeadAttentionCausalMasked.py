    with Linear Attention by Angelos Katharopoulos, Apoorv Vyas, Nikolaos Pappas, FranÃ§ois Fleuret.

    Uses linear feature maps f, to replace the softmax by a kernel k(x,y)->R+.
    so that f(x)*f(y) = k(x,y)

    The authors use the elu feature map.

    This version has causal i.e. forward masking. This cannot be implemented in the usual way due to the
    Q*K term not existing in isolation in this Linear Attention.
    I have implemented it in clumsy way which makes this slower than the usual softmax attention by quite a bit.

    Tne authors of the paper implemented causal attention via a triangular tensor product (and its back prop) in c++.

    I have implemented it in clumsy way which makes this slower than the usual softmax attention by quite a bit
    by introducing an intermediate step with the dimensions of the Q*K product.

    a different masking scheme must be used. Use helperfunctions.forward_mask5() and
